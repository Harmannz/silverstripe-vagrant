# silverstripe-vagrant
This is vagrant code for automatically installing SilverStripe on a new virtual machine on your local computer.      
Only a barebone silverstripe setup is installed on the CentoOS vm. This should allow you to easily configure the code to your needs.   

## Requirements
* Vagrant
* Virtualbox or VMWare

## Getting Started
1. 'clone repo'
2. run 'vagrant up' to install and create vm. **Note:** if you are running vagrant up for the first time it may easily take **20** minutes. This should not only happens the first time.
